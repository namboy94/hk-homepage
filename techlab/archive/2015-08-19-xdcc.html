    <div id="content">
        <p class="written">XDCC is a file transfer protocol used in conjunction with IRC (Internet Relay Chat). Ideally, it offers fast
            transfer times, pausable downloads and high quality media.<br><br>
            To download via IRC/XDCC, you'll need an XDCC-able IRC client. There are many of these available, I recommend Hexchat for a GUI
            solution and irssi for a CLI alternative.<br><br>
            To start a download, you'll typically have to connect to a specific IRC server and join a channel. To do this, enter the following in the
            text field of the IRC client:<br><br>
            <span class="code">/server <span class="variable">irc.server.domain</span></span><br>
            <span class="code">/join #<span class="variable">channel</span></span><br>
            Once you've successfully connected to the server and channel, you're ready to download. To start a download, you'll have to have access to
            a bot's packlist. There are many sites online that keep track of multiple bot's packlist and automatically format the download string for you.
            The download string should be formated like this:<br><br>
            <span class="code">/msg <span class="variable">bot</span> xdcc send #<span class="variable">packnumber</span></span><br>
            The download should start now, depending on your configuration you'll be prompted to accept the file transfer.<br><br>
            That's basically it!
