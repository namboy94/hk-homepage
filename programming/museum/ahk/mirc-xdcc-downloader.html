    <p class="written"><br>An AutoHotKey script with a working GUI that controls mIRC (a popular IRC client for Windows) to download
    files via XDCC automatically.<br><br>
    Initially intended as a way to maximise use of very slow internet connection speeds by having set up
    unsupervised downloads at night. It however also proved useful at better connection speeds as a batch
    downloader.<br><br>
    It's full of horrible hacks and shows use of a gruesome programming style. For a more sophisticated version
    have a look at my new implementation of an XDCC downloader written in c++
    <a class="link" href="../../c++/xdcc-download.html">here.</a><br><br>
    Viewing the source code is highly discouraged, as it may cause insomnia, nausea, or even heart attacks. View it
    at your own risk.<br><br>
    Yes, of course it uses gotos. Though just for the GUI, so I guess that's OK? And there are even some mildly
    helpful comments!<br><br>
    (Download the file and view it in a text editor, it looks marginally better then)</p>
