        <h3>Setting up SSH Key Authentication</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p class="written">SSH is a versatile tool native to Unix operation systems. It can be used to gain
            terminal access to a computer on the same network, or even just for transferring files,
            all while being securely encrypted.<br><br>
            Normally, a password is used to connect via SSH, but there's a more convenient and more secure way.
            Using a public/private key pair is incredibly convenient and more secure than passwords.<br><br>
            To set up SSH authentication via private/public keys, you'll have to enter the following command in the
            terminal of the client PC you want to use:<br><br>
            <span class="code">ssh-keygen -t rsa</span><br>
            Now, you'll be prompted to enter a name as well as a passphrase for the key pair. Leave both blank for maximum convenience.<br>
            Exceptions to this would be: If you already have a private/public RSA key pair, change the name. If you want more security at
            the expense of convenience, enter a passphrase. This tutorial will assume that the key is saved as .ssh/id_rsa, which is the
            default.<br><br>
            You now have a key pair, the private key is saved as .ssh/id_rsa, the public key as .ssh/id_rsa.pub<br><br>
            Now you'll have to set up you host to accept that key. To do this, just copy the contents of the public key (id_rsa.pub) to
            ~/.ssh/known_hosts on the host/server. Save the changes and that should be it.<br><br>
            To test if the procedure worked, enter the following command from the client's terminal:<br><br>
            <span class="code">ssh <span class="variable">user</span>@<span class="variable"></span>server</span><br>
            You should now be connected via SSH without a password prompt.
