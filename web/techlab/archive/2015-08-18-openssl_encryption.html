        <h3>Encrypting files with OpenSSL using public keys</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p class="written">To encrypt files using OpenSSl, you'll have to first create a public/private key set.
            To do this, enter the following commands in a linux terminal (If you already have an RSA key pair, you
            can skip this step):<br><br>
            <span class="code">ssh-keygen -t rsa</span><br>
            and set it up to your liking. Ideally, you would use the default file name for the key files and refrain
            from using a passphrase.<br>
            Then, navigate to the .ssh directory using<br><br>
            <span class="code">cd .ssh</span><br>
            Afterwards, generate .pem keys to be used with OpenSSL. To do this, enter the following commands:<br><br>
            <span class="code">openssl rsa -in id_rsa -outform pem > id_rsa.pem</span><br>
            <span class="code">openssl rsa -in id_rsa -pubout -outform pem > id_rsa.pub.pem</span><br>
            Now, we will generate a random 256 bit key:<br><br>
            <span class="code">openssl rand -base64 32 > key.bin</span><br>
            <span class="code">openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey id_rsa.pub.pem -pubin -in key.bin -out key.bin.enc</span><br>
            Now we're ready to encrypt our files. To do this, enter the following commands in the terminal while being
            in the .ssh directory:<br><br>
            <span class="code">openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in <span class="variable">Input</span> -out <span class="variable">Output.enc</span> -pass file:key.bin</span><br>
            Output.enc is your encrypted file. The Encryption is now done!<br>
            To decrypt the file again, you'll need access to your original keys, so don't lose them!<br>
            The command to decrypt the file is:<br><br>
            <span class="code">openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in <span class="variable">Input.enc</span> -out <span class="variable">Output</span> -pass file:key.bin</span><br>
            For faster en- and decrypting you can use the following two bash scripts once you did the original setup.</p>
