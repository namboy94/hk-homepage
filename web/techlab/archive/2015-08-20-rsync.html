        <h3>Using Rsync for backing up or transferring files</h3>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
        <p class="written">Rsync is a very useful program to backup files or even just for transferring them.
            It verifies every operation using checksums, making sure that no data loss occurs during the data transfer.
            This makes it superior to operations like mv.<br><br>
            The basic syntax of an rsync command is as follows:<br><br>
            <span class="code">rsync <span class="variable">options</span> <span class="variable">source</span> <span class="variable">destination</span></span><br>
            The most important options are:</p>
        <ul class="ul_in_text">
            <li>-a    Archive Mode, should normally be used</li>
            <li>-v    Verbose Mode, prints the perfrmed actions to the terminal</li>
            <li>-n    Dry Run Mode, for testing. If this option is enabled, no changes will be made</li>
            <li>--delete-after    Deleted files that don't exist in the source directory after the rsync command itself</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="written">Using rsync with a remote server, for instance via SSH, you'll need the following syntax:<br><br>
            <span class="code"><span class="variable">user</span>@<span class="variable">server</span>:<span class="variable">path</span></span><br><br>
            Use case Examples:<br><br>
            Copying files from one local drive to another:<br>
            <span class="code">rsync -av /mnt/disk1/folder/ /mnt/disk2/folder</span><br>
            Backing up the Home drive to a NAS via SSH:<br>
            <span class="code">rsync -av /home/user user@server:/mnt/disk/backups</span><br>
            List files missing from your PC that are available on a remote server:<br>
            <span class="code">rsync -anv user@server:/mnt/disk/secrets/ /home/user/secrets</span><br>
            Synchronize a folder on a server with a local folder, making the remote folder the same as the local folder:<br>
            <span class="code">rsync -anv --delete-after /home/user/stuff/ user@server:/mnt/disk/stuff</span><br><br>
            Note that sometimes an "/" is appended to the end of a directory. If this is the case, the content of the directory is synced.
            If the "/" is ommited, The folder itself is synced.
